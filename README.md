# Formula Sheets
Collection of LaTeX formula sheets for UBC Engineering Physics courses.

During my time at University I found it helpful to create custom formula sheets to highlight important details in our classes. I created these sheets using LaTeX and shared them with my peers. Some of these formula sheets were used by over 1000 students while others were adopted by my professors for use in midterms or final exams.
